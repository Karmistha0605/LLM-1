# Week 1 — Assignment: Python Problem Solving

> **Big Idea:**
> Apply Python to solve new problems that reinforce your skills in **data structures, functions, error handling, and regex**. Focus on writing **robust, reusable code** and thinking critically about edge cases.

---

## Instructions

* Solve **all 10 questions** in Python.
* Each solution should be implemented as a **separate function** with clear **docstrings**.
* Handle **edge cases** like empty inputs, invalid types, or unexpected formats.
* Use **lists, dictionaries, sets, and regex** where appropriate.
* No AI-generated solutions; rely on Python and your problem-solving skills.

## Questions

### **1. Sentence Word Lengths**

Write a function that takes a sentence and returns a dictionary mapping each word to its length.

* Ignore punctuation.
* Treat words case-insensitively.

---

### **2. Common Elements in Lists**

Write a function that takes two lists and returns a **set of elements that appear in both lists**.

* Works for any data type (numbers, strings).
* Handle empty lists gracefully.

---

### **3. Count Unique Characters**

Write a function that takes a string and returns the **number of unique characters** (ignore spaces and case).

---

### **4. Factorial with Error Handling**

Write a function `safe_factorial(n)` that returns the factorial of `n`.

* Return `None` if `n` is negative or not an integer.

---

### **5. Reverse Words**

Write a function that takes a sentence and returns a new sentence with **each word reversed**, but the **word order remains the same**.

* Ignore punctuation.

---

### **6. Validate Password**

Write a function that checks if a password string meets the following conditions:

* At least 8 characters
* At least one uppercase letter
* At least one lowercase letter
* At least one digit
* Return `True` if valid, `False` otherwise.

---

### **7. Extract Hashtags**

Write a function that extracts all hashtags from a text string using regex (words starting with `#`).

* Return a list of hashtags without the `#` symbol.

---

### **8. Remove Duplicates**

Write a function that takes a list and returns a **new list with duplicates removed**, preserving the original order.

---

### **9. Sum Numbers in Text**

Write a function that takes a string and **sums all the numbers** found in the text using regex.

* Example: `"I have 3 apples and 4 oranges"` → `7`

---

### **10. Find Anagrams**

Write a function that takes a list of words and returns a **dictionary grouping anagrams together**.

* Key: sorted characters of the word
* Value: list of words that are anagrams of each other
